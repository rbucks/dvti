By transforming and streamlining the negotiating process, PIVOT lends its clients more time to focus on their marketing platforms, creative executions and advertising opportunities presented by the hyper-sensitive and acutely aware customers we call fans. During its inception, PIVOT also saw an opportunity to simplify team travel for professional teams and large events, creating a third business vertical within the company. By offering a free 360 degree travel service, PIVOT ensures teams receive money back from their many stays throughout the season.

From our founder Bill Larson’s first little Round Table Pizza Parlor in Menlo Park, California in 1959 to 450 thriving restaurants today, Round Table has always stood for freshness, innovation and craveable flavors in everything we serve. Most pizza chains use primarily frozen dough, and often skimp on both the quality and quantity of their toppings and ingredients to cut costs. Not at Round Table. We roll our dough fresh, from scratch, every day, in every restaurant. That dough is made from wheat grown for us on family farms in Idaho. Our cheddar cheese is aged to perfection, and combined with whole milk mozzarella and provolone in our famous three–cheese blend. We use only premium meats for our toppings, which we spread lavishly on every pizza, all the way to the edge of the crust. And our vegetable toppings are freshly cut at each restaurant, including our juicy, selectively–picked tomatoes. This commitment to quality and authenticity is why we say we’re “The Last Honest Pizza.” While we’re proud of the ingredients we use, Round Table is more than just freshness and quality. We’re the place where you’ll find unique, innovative pizza creations that expertly combine flavors no one else can match. Over the years we’ve introduced more than 30 successful new products, including many that are mainstays of our menu today. There’s the legendary King Arthur’s Supreme, with pepperoni, Italian sausage, Italian dry salami, linguica, mushrooms, green peppers, yellow onions, black olives, three cheeses and our Zesty Red Sauce. And the Wombo Combo, featuring primo pepperoni, linguica, Italian sausage, crisp bacon, mushrooms, Roma tomatoes, artichoke hearts and green onions. There are many more delightful combinations to choose from, or you can select your crust, sauce and toppings and create your own masterpiece. With appetizers like our Garlic Parmesan Twists, and salad bars offering an array of fresh selections, Round Table presents a feast of flavors that bring our guests back again and again, whether they choose to dine in, carry out or have us deliver.

Gutensite’s intuitive CMS is the backbone of an affordable, full-service ecosystem that supports clients with strategy, design, development and ongoing website management.  Gutensite was originally founded in San Francisco in 2002 as a boutique design firm and launched the beta version of their CMS in 2008 after years of learning what small businesses need. Gutensite is now scaling their platform and attracting other design agencies who need a great CMS and a technical partner to help them serve a wider client base. The Gutensite CMS is designed to provide the essential features that all websites need, as well as useful industry-specific functionality, while still being easy for non-technical publishers. Their CMS is optimized for building professional websites, and is not targeted for hobby website builders. The platform empowers Gutensite designers and other partner design agencies to craft memorable and engaging websites that streamline the administrative workflow and make it easy to maintain a professional web presence. Gutensite's roots as a design firm have shaped a simple control panel that empowers distributed content management roles without worrying about how the site will look, because the CMS protects the professional design so publishers can produce beautiful content with less effort. Gutensite's engaged support staff also take a proactive role in making sure clients' websites provide ongoing value and are optimized for specific conversion goals.  Gutensite operates in a critical niche between two poles in the CMS market. It has the power, flexibility and scalability of an enterprise level CMS like Drupal and Concrete5, but the instant setup and easy to use features of hosted platforms like Squarespace and Wix. It comes with a full support ecosystem that makes it a plug and play option for small businesses who need a website that delivers a great return on investment.

Our initial focus is on developing cloud-based applications for the management of solar photovoltaic facilities ranging in size from small residential rooftop systems to multi-megawatt utility-scale power plants. Between 2011 and 2012, the solar industry grew 76% and is expect to grow approximately 30% year-over-year from now until the end of 2016. By then, the U.S. could have nearly 1 million individual solar installations. For those assets installed under a Third-Party Ownership (TPO) model – approximately 85% of the total – there exists a unique set of management requirements: performance benchmarking, billing and ticketing, vendor workflow communication, and reporting, among others. Performing these vital back-office functions for a portfolio of hundreds or thousands of small power plants requires a new set of software tools, unlike those built for the conventional power industry. Energy Informatics has built these tools. We have built the Energy Informatics Back Office Suite so that solar financiers, integrators, and service providers can manage fast-growing fleets of small power plants better, faster, and cheaper with minimal personnel. We provide these capabilities in the cloud. It’s the best way to deliver software to an industry growing fast across multiple markets and a changing regulatory landscape. We handle the complexity. In exchange, our customers pay us subscription fees based on the sites or capacity under management.","San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",2011-01-01,year,info@energyinformatics.com,925-954-1850,http://www.linkedin.com/company/2664848,,,,Private,,,,11-50,"Energy, Natural Resources, Software, Sustainability",,

Company has developed new paradigms & cutting edge timing signoff methodologies, which have allowed creating new statistical tools that are superior to commercially available STA/SSTA tools. The tools prevent timing violations in critical paths that lead to silicon failure & remove timing pessimism in the rest of paths. Abelite’s unique & truly statistical tools offer:  	- Modeling all conceivable global/local, random/correlated sources of variations including EDA tools/flow/libraries inaccuracies/errors, PVT & geometry variations in cells, wires/vias, Double Patterning Technology (DPT), Aging Degradation (AD), Layout Dependent Effects (LDE) & FinFET  	- Estimating timing yield & power consumption 	- Achieving timing signoff with needed confidence & with taking into account the number of timing critical paths, and  	- Performing optional signoff at all needed PVT/RC/Via/AD/DPT corners Abelite methodology prevents silicon failure while improving design performance, power & area, obtaining best QoR & reduces TAT, Costs & TTM. Methodology & tools were verified on multiple test-cases & designs for several technology nodes.  Business Value: All current designs are at risk of silicon failure due to drawbacks in conventional EDA tools & methodologies that may overlook violations in few paths with “untypical” structures & properties. At the same time, most companies use too many PVT/RC/Via corners & these corners (libraries) are pessimistically characterized for most logical & clock stages. On top, unjustified & often conservative timing derates are used along with OCV/AOCV/POCV/LOCV/SOCV timing derating methods in STA tools, which are not accurate & have multiple drawbacks. It results in risk of silicon failure in few paths & overdesigning & over-margining the majority of paths.  Abelite provides new advanced tools, which are complimentary to current commercial STA/SSTA tools. Abelite will provide best-in-industry consulting in all areas of timing signoff, work with customers to specify their needs, limitations & goals. Customers decide what additional characterization of technology, designs & EDA tools they will do, what data they will share & what services they require. Abelite will provide answers to all customers’ requests including support on conventional timing derating like AOCV/POCV/LOCV. Customers are not required to change their EDA tools (it may be PrimeTime or Encounter Timing Analyzer/Tempus) & design flows. All Abelite tools & methodologies are unique & not available from other EDA vendors.

The company has developed and tested the platform, secured a breadth of blue-chip non-profit partners, acquired soft launch customers, and developed a pipeline of interested brands.

ProspectMatch,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/prospectmatch,"Education, Finance, Insurance, Software","Concord, California, United States",,Closed,For Profit,http://www.prospectmatch.com,"ProspectMatch provides extensive training as part of its lead generation program. This is necessary because thereâ€™s a significant number of people in financial sales that have inadequate sales skills or talents. This results in them blowing the value of the lead when they call the prospect and approach the prospect inappropriately. For example, the insurance agent gets a lead for prospect who requested a booklet on annuities. He then picks up the phone calls Mrs. Smith and says, â€œMrs. Smith, I understand you want to buy an annuity.â€ Mrs. Smith is taken back as she has been approached with no finesse and inappropriately. This type of salesperson needs to be trained how to approach the prospect about the prospectâ€™s agenda rather than the salespersonâ€™s agenda. A big part of this training that ProspectMatch uses comes from the book Spin Selling. That book teaches the importance of asking questions rather than speaking. So we use the findings of that research to train the financial professional to call and ask a series of questions that ascertains the emotional motivations of the prospect. Once that motivation is clarified, the professional then has a hook in order to have the prospect take the next step, which is typically to schedule a meeting.","San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",2005-10-12,day,help@prospectmatch.com,866-952-4065,,,http://twitter.com/prospectmatch,,Private,,,,11-50,"Education, Financial Services, Software",,
